Software    : MATLAB R2013a


Note:
Run the TwoLinkCSpace.m file. Use "Run and Advance" button to see the results shown in the simulation. 

To see generated path in DijkstraTorus.m (the yellow line shown in vdo) make sure DEBUG variable is set 'true' in the DijkstraTorus.m file. To generate '*.mat' file for the assignment you'll have to set it back to 'false'.
